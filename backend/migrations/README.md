# Database Migrations

Alembic keeps the database schema in sync with the application models.

## Common commands

```bash
# Create a new revision with an autogenerated diff
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Roll back the most recent migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

Each revision lives in `versions/`.  Generated files should be committed so every environment can reproduce the same schema state.
